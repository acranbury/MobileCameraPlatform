Mobile Camera Platform - Alan, Jack, Mark

Pros and Cons

Pros:
Source control
	We used git, it worked pretty well, we were all able to keep the
	project in sync.
Serial Communications
	No problems with serial comms from the beginning, no dropped data
Fully functional robot
	Achieved all required objectives
Group communication
	We communicated well throughout the whole project
Image recognition
	Under standard conditions we didn't have any problems, we used a
	simple algorithm and it worked without much wrangling
LASER
	We had a toggleable red laser pointer to aid with the aiming of the
	camera.

Cons:
DTMF
	We attempted to implement Goertzel, and spent too much time on it when
	it didn't work very well. Convolution just worked from the get go.
Control law
	The control law was not originally implemented correctly, the
	integration part was not being taken into account, which messed up our
	speed control.
Joystick
	The joystick had some problems with timing, many commands were being
	sent in a row, with long delays between bursts of commands. This was
	replaced with code from the other group, which just worked the first
	time.
Laptop
	All the project depended on Alan's laptop, since it was our Linux box
	to control the robot.
Secret resistor
	There was a secret resistor in the encoders, which messed up the
	encoder connector design.
